        <li>QB</li>

    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of players is allowed. Trades will process in 2 days and will be reversed if vetoed or under investigation for collusion. Tradable assets include players.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment.</p>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.2 Trade Deadline</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>The trade deadline will be set for the Saturday of the week 10 games of the NFL season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFive}>1.2.3 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 7 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a backup kicker). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>
    
    <p>Rolling Waivers Waiver wire system. Waivers will process Tuesdays 3 AM EST.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2: Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year will be a linear draft in reverse order of the previous yearâ€™s regular season standings.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3: Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4: Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. Each team that wins their division and the 4 wild card teams that finish with the best records, will receive a playoff berth. The 2 teams that win their division will receive a bye week in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will only last one week and the winner will advance. Week 18 will not be used.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Playoff Points</li>
	    <p> Each week teams get awarded playoff points based on their finish that week. So if you scored the most, you get 10 points, least gets 1 point. </p>
        <li>Head 2 Head Record</li>
        <li>Total Points For</li>
        <li>Coin Flip</li>
        <li>Duel to the death</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5: Keepers Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 Keepers Policy</h3>
    <p>Each team gets to choose 2 keepers who can be retained for 2 more seasons. Keepers have to be specified right before the draft starts and teams lose the draft round picks based on the sleeper ADP of that respective player. ADP of 1 to 12 is Round 1, 12.1 to 24 is Round 2 and similar. </p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 6: League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>6.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected through Venmo. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of regular season. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, a 10% penalty will be addd to their payment and will go towards the payouts at the end of the year.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>6.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: {dues * 5}$</li>
        <li>2nd place: {dues * 2.5}$</li>
        <li>3rd place: {dues * 1.5}$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
